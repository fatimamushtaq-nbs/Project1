I like to travel around Europe. Stayed in a lot of places with airbnb. Respectful, quiet and clean.

Looks like I've got no reviews, but I have a lot of airbnb experience because I have had an airbnb for 4 years with my ex-boyfriend! (150+ reviews). He kept the listing and our house so I had to make a new profile :)

This former industrial plot, also known as De Ceuvel, has been converted into one of the most unique and sustainable urban developments in Europe. The outcome is truly mind-blowing. Old houseboats have been hoisted on land and the jetty connecting the vessels isn’t hanging over water but over a green ocean of soil-cleaning plants. Each boat houses creative and social startups or artists showing a true entrepreneurial and sustainable spirit. While the jetty offers some seriously great spots to unwind, café De Ceuvel attracts the biggest crowds. On hot summer days (yes, we do have those) the terrace transforms into a lively festival-like wharf making it hard to believe the city center is just a 5-minute bike ride away.

From the airport (Schiphol) The airport is not far from the city center. By taxi it takes approx. 30 minutes to get to Asile Flottant, but quite a bit longer during rush hours. The cost of a taxi from the airport will be around 70 euros. The train is a lot cheaper and quite convenient since the airport houses a railway station with direct links to the Central Railway Station (approx. 15 minutes/ 5 euros one way). From there you can either continue by foot or by bus. By foot or by bike Do as the Romans do and hop on a (rental) bike.

And together we are 'Team Asile'. The moment we got to know of Asile Flottant it was love at first sight and we truly feel privileged being part of such a unique, sustainable and once-in- a-lifetime project. The fleet feels like a small herd to us; we truly care about each ship and we can’t really say which is our favorite. The vessels have so much character and style, all in their own beautiful way, that we just got equally attached to all of them. We all have our own role at Asile Flottant. David is the one you probably have contact with when you prepare for your trip. He is our 'back-office' hero and he makes sure all the paperwork is in order. Irene is our senior host. She invented """"service with a smile"""" and if you are lucky she will be the one to check you in upon arrival. Also Irene is the girl to contact whenever you want to organize something special to make your trip even better! Esther and Feikje are also hosts of Asile Flottant and also very happy to welcome you. Last but not least there are Huib and Sam, They are our technical engineers and they can fix/build/repare (almost) anything! 

The best thing about our work? Okay, this sounds like an advertising-answer, but honestly: it’s you! Having you here with us to see how you fall in love with your ship, with De Ceuvel and with our city fills us with joy. Actually, it’s the best energizer ever! If you have any questions please drop us a line. We’d be more than happy to answer any question you might have. Even better: we’d love to welcome you on our pier one day soon. We’re looking

37,  Dutch/American, grew up in South East Asia, and wound up settling down in Amsterdam for the past 11 years after College in Maine. 1 year became 11 the way life goes :) Speaks highly for Amsterdam's appeal. I fell in love with it's down-to-earth, healthy, village-like city feel. 

I'm an Ayurvedic Life style practitioner, holistic masseuse, healthy meals cook, and English language consultant. 
Also addicted to my daily dose of hot/hatha yoga. Happy to give guests tips of  what Amsterdam has to offer relating to Holistic activities, dining etc.

The first 6 years of my time in Amsterdam I owned an art gallery specialising in Contemporary Chinese and Vietnamese painting. Amsterdam has much to offer on the art front for those into the art scene.

For guests who are interested, there is the option of having massage treatments or Ayurvedic consultations should you stay with me. Those wanting more information can inquire at check-in.

I love meeting guests from all over the world and having them stay.
I have a ragdoll cat who thinks he's a dog and loves people. He stays on my wing of the flat unless guests want to give the little tiger a cuddle.

I love wine and good food, nature walks, everything from ballet to opera and soul, warm travel destinations or city-trips and being creative in general.

Looking forward to meeting those of you who stay with me!

So much to see and do! Although in the heart of action and things to do, the street is quiet, full of other houses with quintessential Dutch character and feels residential - perfect if you want an authentic experience. It's located right near the grand and palatial Rijksmuseum, a short walk from the famous Heiniken Experience museum and 2 streets either side from the picturesque Amsterdam canals. Around the corner you'll find a plethora of galleries, shops, theaters/cinemas and dining and evening entertainment possibilities. The apartment is a 8min walk to the buzzing Leidesplein, 10 mins walk from the Amstel, 15 mins walk to the renown """"9 streets"""" in the historic Jordaan area.

The 397 bus will take you straight from the airport (catch it from bus stop B15 and costs just 5eur) to the Rijksmuseum, from where the apartment is a short 5min walk. From central station there are several tram connections which will stop within 300m of the apartment. A taxi from central will take you ca. 4mins to get here, depending on traffic. Getting around AMSTERDAM: We highly recommend you adopt the full Dutch mentality while here and hire a bike. It’s the most cost and time efficient way to get around. 300m down the street there is a great bike rental place called “Het Zwarte Fietsenplan” in the Lijnbaansgracht where you can rent bikes. The city is not so big, and this way you can cover a lot in less time.  Alternatively Uber is a handy!","Access to the apartment is via the outer stairwell and it's the first door (the left door) facing the stairs.

This quiet residential area is easy to access and in the heart of the city, however offers a peaceful and relaxing place to call home surrounded by nature and greenery.  It’s just a 15 minute walk from Central Station but a whole world away from the hustle and bustle of the vibrant city centre. No wonder the Plantage (or East Canal) district is considered by locals and visitors alike to be one of the best neighborhoods in this amazing city right now. Hop on a bike or head out for a casual stroll and you’ll find museums, parks,  bars and restaurants along the many canals that crisscross the area.","Public Transport is close by, you will love our house!  If you have questions let us know!","Our house is in a great spot for getting practically anywhere in the city - but you'll be surprised by how peaceful and quiet the area is. The closest tram stops are at Artis, Plantage Lepellaan and Weesperplein (numbers 9, 10 and 14). The nearest metro stations are Waterlooplein and Weesperplein. Cycling is probably the best way to get around and fit in with the locals – although not for the faint-hearted - and it’s very easy to rent bikes in Amsterdam. You can easily walk to Amsterdam Central Station but if you prefer, take metro lines 51, 53 or 54 from Waterlooplein or tram line 9 from Artis. To get to and from Schiphol airport, take metro line 51 from Weesperplein to Amsterdam Zuid station then take a train from the same station on to the airport (they’re very frequent).
